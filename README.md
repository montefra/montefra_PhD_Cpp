* Commonfunctions: functionalities common to other products
* FT: 1D Fourier Transform between correlation function and power spectrum
* Lognormal: attempt at log normal mocks (didn't work)
* MCMC: test a model against simulations using MCMC
* Power_spectrum: measure the power spectrum using FFTW
* tclap-1.2.1: C++ command line library; [docs](http://tclap.sourceforge.net/)
* Theories: compute theory power spectra
* WindowFunction: given a spherical averaged window function in k-space computes the matrix version of it
